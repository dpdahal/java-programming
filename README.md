## History of Java
* Java was developed by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems, Inc. in 1991.

## Java Features
1. Simple
2. Object-Oriented
3. Portable
4. Platform Independent
5. Secured
6. Robust
7. Architecture Neutral
8. Interpreted
9. High Performance
10. Multithreaded
11. Distributed

## Input and Output
* Output: System.out.println("Hello World");
* Input: Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
* sc.next(): get only one word without space
* sc.nextLine(): get whole line with space
* sc.nextInt(): get integer value
* sc.nextFloat(): get float value
* sc.nextDouble(): get double value
* sc.nextBoolean(): get boolean value
* sc.nextByte(): get byte value
* sc.nextShort(): get short value
* sc.nextLong(): get long value
* sc.close(): close the scanner object

## Variables
* variable is a container which holds the value while the java program is executed.
* variable is a name of memory location.
##  Rules for defining a variable:
    * variable name must be start with alphabet or _ or $.
    * after first letter, variable name can be a combination of letters, digits, _ and $.
    * variable name should not be matched with keywords.
    * variable name is case-sensitive.

## Data Types
* Data type is a classification of data, which can store a specific type of information.
## There are two types of data types in Java:
### Primitive data types
### Non-primitive data types
### Primitive data types:
        * byte: 1 byte
        * short: 2 bytes
        * int: 4 bytes
        * long: 8 bytes
        * float: 4 bytes
        * double: 8 bytes
        * char: 2 bytes
        * boolean: 1 bit
### Non-primitive data types:
        * String
        * Array
        * Class
        * Interface
        * etc.
